			<h2> The Evolution of NBA Centers and the 3-Point Line </h2>
			<h4> Over the past 20 years the way that basketball is played in the NBA has changed. And the Role of NBA Centers in particular has expanded to the 3-point line.<br>Oz Elad</h4>

			<h3>Introduction</h3>
			<p>In 1946 Walter Brown, former owner of the Boston Garden, founded the Basketball Association of America, referred to as the BAA. In 1949 it merged with the National Basketball League, or the NBL, and became the National Basketball Association, better known as the NBA. Since its inception, the NBA has captivated fans worldwide and has grown the sport of basketball to the point where an estimated 450 million people now play it. Within the sport of basketball, there are five positions: point guard, shooting guard, small forward, power forward, and center. Each position has its role, and together they play to win. However, as the sport has evolved over the years, each position's role has changed to better compete, and the center position, in particular, has seen massive changes over the last 20 years. </p>

			<h3>The Evolution of the Center Position</h3>
			<img src="Bball.png" alt="Locations on a Basketball Court" height="250px" width="350px">
			<p>Traditionally, the center position in the NBA is played by the biggest and tallest players on the court. In the older days of the sport, Centers used to play with their backs to the basket and were often parked in the paint, or on the block and would score from those locations in and around the hoop. The only time a center would leave those spots would be if he was setting a screen, or if he was moving to create space for one of his teammates. To newer basketball fans this idea that one player would stay in one spot on the floor is very foreign because nowadays all five players on the court move around through all locations. Specifically, over the last 20 years NBA centers have been required to evolve into playmakers and shotmakers, meaning the position has changed so that centers in the league are now shooting from the 3-point line, not just from under the basket. The growth in 3-point shooting from centers in the NBA has completely changed the game. Imagine trying to guard a team where all five guys are passing and moving around, and the ball ends up in the hands of a 7-foot monster who just rises up and shoots a smooth 3-pointer, this kind of situation is exactly why centers have expanded their games to include the outside shot. To a certain extent, it’s simply unguardable. As Dave Deckard from SportsBlogs Nation said, not having a center that can move around and space the floor, puts your offense at a disadvantage before the possession even starts.</p>

			<h3>The Growth in 3-Point Attempts</h3>
			<p>To quantify the change in 3-point shooting in the center position, in the 2002-2003 NBA season, NBA centers took a combined 497 3-point shots, last season, 2022-2023, NBA centers attempted 6,264 3-pointers, a 1,160% increase! With such an increase in shooting, the way basketball is played in the NBA has flipped on its head, now the game is free-flowing, and the amount of space on the court is abundant for teams with good shooting. 

			However, it is not like these players are just shooting more shots yet missing at the same rate. The average 3-point shooting percentage for centers around the league has doubled from 14% to 28% over the last 20 years. This kind of change in a position in any sport is unheard of, and it goes to show what the modern brand of basketball is looking for out of its center position.

			To some basketball fans, this evolution in the center position is changing the game they love in a way they don’t want. Steven Gilbert, Former Walk-On at Florida State University and current Assistant Coach of the Syracuse Women’s Basketball Team said, “Basketball is adapting, and it’s sad to say, but we are getting away from the traditional back-to-the-basket big.” Gilbert, who has been around basketball for over 30 years now has seen the effects of the 3-point line unfold, and he says that this development comes from what the fans prefer to see. “ Everyone wants to see a high-scoring game, so now for these bigs to be dominant they have to be able to stretch the floor.” </p>

			<h3>Where the Position is Headed</h3>
			<p>The center position in the NBA is still evolving by the day. Some believe it will remain a position that shoots from the 3 but still has a focus on scoring in the paint, others believe the position won’t exist anymore. This idea has grown in popularity over the last few years, as basketball experts have begun to throw around the term “positionless basketball.” Gilbert also feels that this is what basketball will become, five players on the court who can do it all on the offensive end and aren’t tied to a position but instead tied to a role on the team, one that has nothing to do with position but everything to do with performance.</p>
